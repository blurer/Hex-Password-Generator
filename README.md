# Hex password generator [a-f,A-F,0-9]
I made this for fun while learning Python. If my 85 year old grandparents can use a password safe with random passwords, you can too.

<rant>
* Use random passwords.
* Use a damn password safe, preferrably one with cloud sync - https://1password.com/ or https://bitwarden.com/
* Check your email addresses against haveibeenpwned - https://haveibeenpwned.com/
* Use strong passwords with lots of characters. Check the stength at sites like - https://howsecureismypassword.net/
</rant>

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3

### Usage
```
git clone link
cd to directory
chmod +x pwgen.py
./pwgen.py
```
You'll be asked:
- How many characters do you want the password to be?
- How many passwords do you want?

## Example
```
# root @ devbox in ~/Hex-Password-Generator on git:master x [5:31:38] 
$ ./pwgen.py

# What this is...

This is a quick and dirty python3 script to automatically tweet a random password every x seconds. You will need a twitter api key and installing tweepy (pip3 install tweepy --user) priot to use. Youâ€™ll need to enter in the api information within the script, specify the length and quantity of password per tweet, and finally how often they are to be tweeted.
